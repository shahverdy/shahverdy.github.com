Beowulf is an old epic anglo saxon poem, and is known as oldest long poem. Although it is english, all are happening in 
Denmark. To be honest, although the story is very attractive, it is very difficult to read because of the old language. 
I couldn't finish it if I hadn't already seen the related movie (which has fundamental differences).
