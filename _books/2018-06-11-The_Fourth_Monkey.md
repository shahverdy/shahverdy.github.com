A mystery! The story is set in modern day Chicago and tells of a particularly savage serial killer, and 
a Detective who is the head of the hunting team. Also there is a big portion on the story from reading the dairy 
of the killer, which is set in old days of his childhood. What really made me keep reading this novel was the fact that there are chapters 
which read as diary entries that reflect the killer’s thoughts from the moment he was a child. So it shows how a child grew up and what 
he saw in his childhood, that made him a serial killer. 

This is a very intense, dark and disturbing novel to read. The chapters are short, which gives you that “just one more chapter” feeling and I did not want to put it down. EVER. 
I would recomend this book and if you’re a fan of the serial killer thriller then it’s a must read. 

btw, you will see apple products all over the book!
