It sticks you to your chair, even if you are facing 500 pages! Honestly knowing the fact that 
the author is the former US president makes you beleive the environment of the story, specially if you
have seen the House of Cards series! The story lies on a crisis about computers, and unfortunately its the 
weakest part of the book, specially if you are familiar with how IT stuffs work. But generally I liked the book
and recomend you to have a glance. I'm sure you will keep reading it.
