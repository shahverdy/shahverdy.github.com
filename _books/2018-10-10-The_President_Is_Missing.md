It sticks you to your chair, even if you are facing 500 pages! The book captured my attention from page one and I could not put it down.

Honestly knowing the fact that the co-author is the former US president makes you feel its too real to be just a story, specially if you
have seen the *House of Cards* series! The story lies on a crisis about computers, and unfortunately its the 
weakest part of the book, specially if you are familiar with how IT stuffs work. You can find a lot of mistakes about
how the hacking process happened, or how it was solved, but who cares, its a fiction!

Generally I liked the book and I recomend you to have a glance. I'm sure you will keep reading it.
