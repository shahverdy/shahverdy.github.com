My mom is the greatest artist of everywhere of all the times! She creates carpets with her bare hands 
out of nothing and this is not just a beatiful carpet, but something that she puts her heart in it. 
She is weaving this one for me as she made another one as a gift for my older brother's wedding gift :) 
My grandmother was her teacher, and she was one of the bests in the whole world - She kind of retired herself.
My mom has her place now and I'm very happy that she is weaving once again after a long time.
