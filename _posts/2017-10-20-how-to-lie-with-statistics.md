**A few while ago** I was asked to make ability to generate some statistics for one of 
my softwares, and I did it as quick as possible! Although it was working like a charm, I 
realized that it wasn't representing the correct information related to the spirit of 
the software. It made me to do some diggings and it led me to the book titled 'How to Lie with Statistics'

As lately I've been a fan of short read books, I read "How to Lie With Statistics", 
which is one of those types of books that doesn't require you to have a great deal 
with math before trying the book. Although this book is kind of outdated, but
kind of still relevant in public representations and advertisements. It feels
really great when you read something from 60 years ago and most parts are still
fresh! Reading [_the list of recomended books by the Wall street Journal_](https://blogs.wsj.com/totalreturn/2014/11/25/best-books-for-investors-a-short-shelf/){:target="\_blank"}, At first it was the title that attracted me, and then all fantastic examples kept me reading! 
All examples are based on social and economic values of 1954, but you can 
still feel the freshness of them, specially when you think about our current social networks and politicians!
I can tell that many statisticians use information represented in this book all the time!
The techniques described by the author are simple, and any professional should see through them. 
With statistics being presented around every corner in today’s society, some help 
maybe needed to decipher which statistics are truly suitable.

The main purpose of the book is to show that even though statistics are true, 
they can be misrepresentative of information, and it tries to help you
find those false pulses. There are many errors in representations in books, newspapers,
websites and other stuffs, and this book tries to illustrate them. 

The author describes statistics as "employed to sensationalize, inflate, confuse, and oversimplify". 
He tries to portray intentional and unintentional mistakes, made by people while using
statistics representations. In this book the authors brings up a lot of graphs and 
charts, samples and a lot more to show how statistics can be misrepresented.  
He not only explains these different aspects of statistics in detail, but also reveals the 
importance of being able to differentiate between a legitimate fact
and an imprecise statistic. 

One of the strongest aspects of this book is the detailed illustrations. For example when he 
talks about the one-dimensional picture he not only explains what a one-dimensional picture is, 
but has illustrations to offer further understanding. Since a great deal of statistics 
is portrayed through illustrations, such as graphs, it is important that books about 
statistics include such illustrations. Imagine trying to understand the depiction of a 
graph through a verbal explanation. I believe it would be more difficult than simply looking at a graph.

It took about 4 days to read just a dedication of about 1 hour a day to read can change your professional (or even personal!) life.
After all, I think it would be enjoyable to read this book.
