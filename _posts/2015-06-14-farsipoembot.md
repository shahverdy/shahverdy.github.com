I usually read poems, A LOT! I decided to create a new experience of literature for myself, and thats a new bot for Telegram app.
I created this app for myself, but anyone can use it as its free to use!

When you send your command "/next" to the bot, you get a small part of a poem, then you are free to choose to see the rest of it, or to see another suggestion.

Feel free to try the bot at [@FarsiPoemBot](http://telegram.me/farsipoembot).
